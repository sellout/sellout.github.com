    title: Making [A]GPL More Attractive
    tags: licensing

I’ve often thought that GPL (and it’s Affero variant) should be _more_ attractive to companies than OSS licenses, definitely on the creation side, but also on the usage side. But for various reasons (and with certain high-profile exceptions) that has never really been the case.

There are plenty of standard licenses for the Free part of Free Software, but are there any for the part where companies pay to use it? Having standard “complementary” commercial licenses (and perhaps a common storefront) would make it easier for companies to pay a fair rate for Free Software, rather than donating to Open Source. Many companies have an (understandable) ban on GPL software, because

1. their use is outside of it and
2. it’s not worth their time to negotiate custom licenses with a hundred (and that’s probably a lowball number, even for a startup) individual programmers, who may not even be interested in commercial licensing.

If we had, say, a complement to the GPL, called CPL, then it’s easy for a developer to say “Available under the GPL and CPL licenses.” And a company now quickly knows what that means (just as they already know the requirements of Apache/Mozilla/MIT/BSD/etc.). And, say a dev licenses under GPL and some other “standard” commercial license, the DPL, a company that doesn’t like the DPL can come back and say “would you license that to us under the CPL?” and the developer can make a decision based on (granted, often lay) comparisons that other people have made, rather than having to hire a lawyer to see if the customer is trying to fleece them.

True Freedom fighters can license GPL/non-commercial, being explicit that they are not interested in commercial licensing, letting companies know without wasting anyone’s time.

Thankfully, contributor agreements have become much more common, which simplify the complicated copyright issues when multiple entities contribute to a single Free Software project.

And finally, it’d be nice to have a “broker” site that manages the exchange of money for licenses, so

1. companies feel like they’re dealing with a single provider and
2. hackers don’t need to set up anything special for invoicing etc.
