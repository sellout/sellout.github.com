title: Common Lisp Type Hierarchy
---

I've updated my very old CL class hierarchy image. Of course, it shouldn't need to be updated, since CL hasn't been updated either, but I added all of the types, plus MOP classes, along with some (probably confusing) annotations for things that change depending on whether or not you have the MOP available.
