Imagine a circle that contains all the knowledge within a field:

![](/media/knowledge.png)

I’m interested in the field, so I’ve learned a few things:

![](/media/what I know.png)

But when I talk to others and share that knowledge, they assume I know other things:

![](/media/what people assume.png)

But they know different things than I do:

![](/media/what others know.png)

And I make assumptions about their knowledge, as well:

But there’s a lot we can learn from each other, and those assumptions can either get in the way of that or give us an opportunity to discover more:

Keep sharing.
