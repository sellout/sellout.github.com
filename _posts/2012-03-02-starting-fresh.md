Yet another attempt to get me back to blogging about code. It's been a while, but I have a few posts queued up, so we'll see if I can rebuild the habit. If you're interested in my old stuff, it's still available at [my site](http://blog.technomadic.org/?cat=3) (although much of it has broken code blocks, etc.). Hopefully, not having to deal with running my own blog software or hosting will make it easier for me to keep it going.
