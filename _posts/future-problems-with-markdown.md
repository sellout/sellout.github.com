* fenced code blocks are important, since good code examples should be copy/pasted from working code, and thus having to reindent them with each updated paste is a pain;
* \*foo\* and \_foo\_ both being italics bothers me on some level. I think of \*foo\* as bold, from pre-markup email days, and don't see why @gruber didn't pick up on that; and
* footnotes (which @gruber uses himself) are missing.
